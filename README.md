# Dictionary
I used python to write this program. I created the dictionary by defining key-value pairs within curly braces {} and assigning them to a variable named DATA. Each key is a term, and its respective value is the definition. I used the input() function to input from the user and print(DATA[a]) to showcase the definition of the entered term.
